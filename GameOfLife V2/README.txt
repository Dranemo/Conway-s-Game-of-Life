This game is based on the Conway's Game Of Life created in 1970.
It was coded by Yanaël CAILLOT and Melvin GUELLAF as part of a school project for the Gaming Campus in april 2023.


The instructions are on the console and the game is on the graphic interface.

The sides of the grid are linked to allow more possibilities.
The game have to be paused to allow any changes to the grid.

The rules are :
    - Any living cell with fewer than two living neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
    - Any living cell with two or three living neighbours lives on to the next generation.
    - Any living cell with more than three living neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
    - Any dead cell with exactly three living neighbours becomes a living cell, as if by reproduction.

And the commands are :
    - Click on the white cells to make them live and on the black cells to kill them.
    - Press SPACE to play or pause the game.
    - Press ESCAPE to quit. (When paused)
    - Press R to get a random pattern. (When paused)
    - Press BACKSPACE to empty the grid. (When paused)
    - Press RIGHT or LEFT to change the simulation speed. (When played)
